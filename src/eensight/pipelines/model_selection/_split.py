class StratifiedGroupKFold(_BaseKFold):
    """Stratified K-Folds iterator variant with non-overlapping groups.

    This cross-validation object is a variation of StratifiedKFold attempts to
    return stratified folds with non-overlapping groups. The folds are made by
    preserving the percentage of samples for each class.
    The same group will not appear in two different folds (the number of
    distinct groups has to be at least equal to the number of folds).
    The difference between GroupKFold and StratifiedGroupKFold is that
    the former attempts to create balanced folds such that the number of
    distinct groups is approximately the same in each fold, whereas
    StratifiedGroupKFold attempts to create folds which preserve the
    percentage of samples for each class as much as possible given the
    constraint of non-overlapping groups between splits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.
    shuffle : bool, default=False
        Whether to shuffle each class's samples before splitting into batches.
        Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled.
        This implementation can only shuffle groups that have approximately the
        same y distribution, no global shuffle will be performed.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        When `shuffle` is True, `random_state` affects the ordering of the
        indices, which controls the randomness of each fold for each class.
        Otherwise, leave `random_state` as `None`.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is designed to:
    * Mimic the behavior of StratifiedKFold as much as possible for trivial
      groups (e.g. when each group contains only one sample).
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Stratify based on samples as much as possible while keeping
      non-overlapping groups constraint. That means that in some cases when
      there is a small number of groups containing a large number of samples
      the stratification will not be possible and the behavior will be close
      to GroupKFold.
